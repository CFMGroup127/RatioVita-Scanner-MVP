## Task 1: Plan and Propose Real Scanning Pipeline using AVFoundation + Vision
**Status: ✅ COMPLETED**  
**Date: September 2, 2025**  
**Duration: ~2 hours**

### Task Description
Design a production-ready scanning and OCR pipeline for RatioVita that replaces the current PreviewScannerService mock. The pipeline should support camera capture, multi-page scanning, image preprocessing, and text recognition using Apple frameworks, with a clear API surface for integration into our SwiftUI + SwiftData architecture.

### Deliverables Completed

#### 1. 📋 Comprehensive Implementation Plan (`Docs/ScannerPipelinePlan.md`)
- **Architecture Design**: Complete module/file structure with public APIs
- **Technical Implementation**: AVFoundation and Vision API integration details
- **Data Flow**: Complete flow from capture to SwiftData save
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error scenarios and recovery strategies
- **Implementation Roadmap**: 8-week phased approach with milestones
- **Platform Considerations**: iOS and macOS specific implementation details
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit, integration, and UI testing approaches

#### 2. 🏗️ Complete Foundation Architecture
- **Data Models**: 
  - `Models/Receipt.swift` - SwiftData @Model with relationships and computed properties
  - `Models/ReceiptImage.swift` - Image storage with compression and metadata
  - `Models/ScanResult.swift` - Structured scanning results with OCR data
- **Service Layer**:
  - `Services/ScannerService.swift` - Protocol defining scanning interface
  - `Services/PreviewScannerService.swift` - Mock implementation for previews
- **Utility Layer**:
  - `Utilities/OCRParsing.swift` - Text parsing with confidence scoring
  - `Utilities/ImageProcessing.swift` - Core Image processing pipeline
  - `Utilities/CameraPermissions.swift` - Cross-platform permission handling
  - `Utilities/SampleData.swift` - Sample data for previews and testing

#### 3. 🔧 Production-Ready Components
- **OCR Parsing Engine**: Intelligent text extraction for merchant, date, total with confidence scoring
- **Image Processing Pipeline**: Perspective correction, noise reduction, sharpening, contrast enhancement
- **Permission Management**: Camera and photo library access with user guidance
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error types with recovery suggestions and user-friendly messages
- **SwiftData Integration**: Persistent storage with relationship management

#### 4. 🎨 UI Integration (`Views/ReceiptsView.swift`)
- **Receipts List View**: Complete interface with search and filtering
- **Scanning Integration**: Placeholder scanner view with mock service integration
- **Receipt Detail View**: Detailed receipt display with OCR text and metadata
- **Status Indicators**: Processing status badges and confidence scores
- **Sample Data Support**: 5 sample receipts with realistic data and images

### Technical Achievements

#### Architecture Highlights
- **Clean Separation of Concerns**: Models, services, utilities, and views properly separated
- **Protocol-Based Design**: ScannerService protocol for dependency injection
- **Platform Agnostic**: iOS and macOS support through conditional compilation
- **SwiftUI Integration**: ObservableObject state management with async/await support

#### Key Features
- **Privacy-First**: On-device processing only, no external API calls
- **Performance Optimized**: Async processing, configurable quality/speed trade-offs
- **User Experience**: Intuitive scanning flow with clear feedback and error handling
- **Maintainable**: Testable code structure with comprehensive error handling

#### Data Models
- **Receipt Entity**: Core receipt data with SwiftData relationships
- **ReceiptImage**: Image storage with compression and processing metadata
- **ScanResult**: Structured scanning results with OCR data and processing steps
- **ProcessingStatus**: Status tracking for receipt processing workflow

### Testing & Preview Support
- **Mock Services**: PreviewScannerService generates realistic sample data
- **Sample Data**: 5 sample receipts with varied merchants, amounts, and dates
- **Preview Container**: SwiftData in-memory configuration for SwiftUI previews
- **Sample Images**: Programmatically generated receipt images for testing

### Next Phase Readiness
The foundation is complete and ready for Phase B implementation:
- **RealScannerService**: AVFoundation camera capture implementation
- **CameraCaptureView**: SwiftUI wrapper for camera interface
- **Vision Integration**: Document detection and OCR processing
- **Multi-page Flow**: Sequential scanning with review interface
